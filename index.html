            <p>Hello! My name is Vanesa, I live near to Montevideo, Uruguay with my husband.
                We have been married for 11 years. I was born in Argentina but when I was 11 years old
                my family moved to Uruguay. This was a hard decision but we met the church 
                and our lives changed.
                The last year I had the opportunity to travel arround the world. I went to different countries
                in Asia, like Philippines. This travel gave me many experiences and I knew a lot of people.
                Also I visited temples. I knew the new Camboya Temple and also I visited the new Bangkok Temple, 
                was amazing to see the church is growing in each part of the earth.
            </p>
